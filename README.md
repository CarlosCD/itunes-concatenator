Like [Join Together](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/jointogether.php), but with chapterizing again.

Plan is to use [SublerCLI](https://code.google.com/p/subler/) for the chapterizing.

Current functionality is limited to installing ffmpeg and listing selected tracks in iTunesâ€¦ very much in-progress.
