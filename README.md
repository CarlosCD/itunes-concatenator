Like [Join Together](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/jointogether.php), but with chapterizing again.

Plan is to use [SublerCLI](https://code.google.com/p/subler/) for the chapterizing.

Currently, we can:
    - Select and list tracks from iTunes
    - Concatenate the selected tracks
    - Generate the chapters file
