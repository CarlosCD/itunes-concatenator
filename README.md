Like [Join Together](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/jointogether.php), but with chapterizing again.

Download the latest version: [Track Concatenator](https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/tcatlatest)

Now working, but there are some issues (see [Issues](https://github.com/davidschlachter/itunes-concatenator/issues)). FFMPEG and MP4v2 must be installed in order to concatenate. Only concatenates MP4/AAC files, but does so losslessly.
